# ChromePluginWork

What I want:
1. For every webpage you can create a list of css modifications that you can toggled on and off
* (e.g. make the comment field in Jira bigger)
2. When opening a new tab a start page will be opened AND! the URL will be selected so that you can write immediately in it
